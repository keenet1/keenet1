## About Me
My name is Thomas and I am a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota Data Visualization and Analytics bootcamp. I enjoy learning about new ways to access, analyze, and present data. As an analytical chemist by training, I especially like working with scientific data (especially chromatographic data). My recent bootcamp experience has equipped me with an entirely new set of data analysis skills  - examples of which you can view here in my GitHub repository.
